Program written by Travis D.

The purpose of this program is to enable anyone to quickly create a local backup of the Cybergrind Steam leaderboards for the game Ultrakill.
This program will save the first 5001 entries of each leaderboard to the same folder the executable is run from, unless the option to download all is selected.

Place this program and all the additonal files into an empty folder and run the application.

If you select to download all entries then it may take a while to run. (5 min)
